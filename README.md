# Hi! Santi, nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

I am a front-end developer that tries to improve everyday, learning some new technologies and best practices. Also, I used to repair computers, build community network and "good" hacking practices in my free time or professionally.

At the same time, I usually referee handball matches on national tournaments and territorial categories.

I can not wait for the web life can give me!


## Work statistics

I usually work in my free time on apps that make my life easier (or do not), and I am in love when I see my program deployed!

## Most used languages

Currently I am in love with React, Node.js and MongoDB, but also I have worked with others technologies and methodologies that have not relation with JavaScript directly, like SQL, PHP or Python, between others.
