# Hi! I'm Santi, nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

I am a front-end developer who tries to improve every day, learning some new technologies and best practices. Also, I used to repair computers, build community networks, and "good" hacking practices in my free time or professionally.

At the same time, I usually referee handball matches in national tournaments and territorial categories.

I can not wait for the web life can give me!


## Work statistics

I usually work in my free time on apps that make my life easier (or do not), and I am in love when I see my program deployed!

## CodeWars:

I am practicing algorithms and some more things in my free time to improve my programming logic and learn new methods for resolving issues.

## Most used languages

Currently I am in love with React, Node.js and MongoDB, but also I have worked with others technologies and methodologies that have no relation with JavaScript directly, like SQL, PHP, or Python, among others.
